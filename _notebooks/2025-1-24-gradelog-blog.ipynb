    "### db_init (Clear)\n",
    "\n",
    "To run db_init, once must go to their backend repository and run the following in their VS Code terminal: `scripts/db_init.py`.

    "```\n",

    "This output is telling us that all tables or, more pragmatically speaking, all our data in our databases, have been cleared. Additionally, new data is being generated, assuming you have default data that needs to be automatically added. When it comes to default data, there can be extra output depending if one has added such or not.\n",
