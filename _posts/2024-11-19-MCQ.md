### What I Learned
If there is anything I took away from this quiz is the breadth and depth of computer science---something that isn't inclusive just to coding but to networking, cybersecurity, algorithms, and much much more.

### Weaknesses
Questions involving algorithmic coding were often a challenge and made up the bulk of the questions I got wrong.


### Questions I got Wrong
- Q30: 
    Need to be more observant with how many times a function is called
- Q31: 
    Need to trace each step to the end
- Q43: 
    Polynomial algorithms run in a reasonable amount of time?
- Q44: 
    Dumb mistake; 2^4 = 16 possible integers so anything at or below won't cause an overflow error
- Q52: 
    Different order; same result
- Q56: 
    Need to carefully count the steps
- Q57: 
    Substrings confusion (need practice on that)
