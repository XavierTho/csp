### What I Learned
If there is anything I took away from this quiz is the breadth and depth of computer science---something that isn't inclusive just to coding but to networking, cybersecurity, algorithms, and much much more.

### Weaknesses
Questions involving algorithmic coding were often a challenge and made up the bulk of the questions I got wrong.

### Questions I got Wrong
- Q30:  
    Need to be more observant with how many times a function is called

- Q31:  
    Need to trace each step to the end

- Q43:  
    Polynomial algorithms run in a reasonable amount of time?

- Q44:  
    Dumb mistake; 2^4 = 16 possible integers so anything at or below won't cause an overflow error

- Q52:  
    Different order; same result

- Q56:  
    Need to carefully count the steps

- Q57:  
    Substrings confusion (need practice on that)
